# Express.js and HaperDB on Linode

In this series, we'll be setting up a Node.js application running Express.js and HarperDB on Ubuntu on Linode. You can use any Ubuntu LTS from version 18.04 and, but we'll be using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for this guide.

The goal of this is to introduce you to leveraging the flexible HarperDB database along with a minimal Express.js application. The HarperDB instance will be running on Linode we'll our Express.js web server will be running just on our local machine.
